            <h2>Guitarist</h2>
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Self-taught guitarist since secondary school, she views her guitar as a ‘best friend,’ a companion that supports her on her musical journey.</p>
            <div class="video">
                <h3>Fingerpicking and Percussive Rhythms</h3>
                <p class="quote">"At this moment, it felt more dynamic, because I was doing fingerpicking and some percussive movements, so it felt like I had a more rhythmic feel of the guitar rather than if I were just strumming."</p>

            <p>Her journey began in secondary school, influenced by friends who played during recess. She was drawn to the guitar's versatility and ease of learning, finding it a flexible instrument for accompaniment.</p>

            <div id="background-origin" class="content-box">
                <h2>Background & Origin</h2>
                <p>Starting in secondary school, she was drawn to guitar by the school’s vibrant music culture. Friends taught her basic chords, sparking a love for the instrument's versatility.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="physical-comfort" class="content-box">
                <h2>Physical Comfort & Adaptation</h2>
                <p>Initially, the steel strings caused discomfort, limiting her playing time. Over time, callouses formed, allowing her to play with ease. She now appreciates the balance between the physical demands of playing and the comfort developed through practice.</p>

                <h2>Tactile Awareness & Rhythmic Connection</h2>
                <p>Playing guitar requires a unique tactile awareness, especially during fingerpicking and rhythmic tapping, as seen in the video. She describes a conscious physicality when positioning her hands and wrists to play comfortably and effectively.</p>

                <h2>Emotional Bond with the Guitar</h2>
                <p>She likens her guitar to a ‘best friend’ rather than an extension of herself. Her attachment goes beyond functionality; she regularly cleans and cares for her guitar, seeing it as a companion that brings her comfort.</p>

                <p>As she hones her guitar skills, she begins to see herself as a musician on the path to mastery. She believes that improving her touch and control will affirm her identity as a guitarist.</p>

            <p>His journey with the clarinet began at a young age, inspired by his father’s playing and driven by his own curiosity. He was captivated by the instrument’s unique sound and complexity, finding it a natural fit despite initial challenges with its size and technique.</p>

                <p>Starting around age eight, inspired by his father, the clarinetist chose the clarinet despite initial encouragement to learn piano. Over the years, he has played on three different clarinets, with his longest-used instrument holding strong emotional significance. Each instrument transition required an adjustment period, reinforcing his connection to familiar setups.</p>

                <h2>Tactile Awareness & Physical Interaction</h2>
                <p>The clarinet offers a deeply tactile experience for him, with each key press providing precise feedback. Unlike instruments requiring approximate placement, the clarinet’s fixed key positions offer him a sense of assurance. His embouchure, or mouth shape, is essential for controlling airflow and tone, with specific notes demanding careful positioning of his tongue and throat. Variations in finger pressure, air speed, and mouth positioning allow him to shift tonal quality and control tuning, making tactile awareness crucial to his playing.</p>

                <p>He describes a "love-hate" relationship with his instrument, particularly when using natural reeds due to their variability. Switching to synthetic reeds has stabilized this connection, providing consistent sound. His clarinet feels like a reliable “acquaintance” rather than an extension of himself, a tool treated with respect to achieve optimal performance.</p>

                <p>For him, touch mastery includes not only fingers but also embouchure and tongue. When performing emotionally intense pieces like Poulenc’s Sonata, he relies on muscle memory for precision and expressive tonguing techniques. His teacher emphasizes that emotional intention must align with technical skill, making touch mastery essential for conveying emotion.</p>

                <p>The clarinet offers a deeply tactile experience for him, with each key press providing precise feedback. Unlike instruments requiring approximate placement, the clarinet’s fixed key positions offer him a sense of assurance. His embouchure, or mouth shape, is essential for controlling airflow and tone, with specific notes demanding careful positioning of his tongue and throat. Variations in finger pressure, air speed, and mouth positioning allow him to shift tonal quality and control tuning, making tactile awareness crucial to his playing.</p>
